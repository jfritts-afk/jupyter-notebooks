# jupyter-notebooks

This is where I will submit my notebooks from jupyter. 

## Getting Started 
This is going to be the repository that will hold all of the notebooks that have been created and need to be submitted

## Folder Structure
## this is meant to serve illustrative purposes only filenames will differ for prjects. [notebooks, data, images, scripts will be named as such] 
- jupyter-notebooks/
    - README.md <<<[ ## you are here ##]
    - notebooks/
        - project1/ (descriptive names will be used)
            - notebook1.ipynb
            - notebook2.ipynb
            - ...
        - project2/
            - notebook1.ipynb
            - notebook2.ipynb
            - ...
        - ...
    - data/ (stored datasets or data files)
        - dataset1.csv
        - dataset2.csv
        - ...
    - images/ (if notebooks need images or plots)
        - image1.png
        - image2.png
        - ...
    - scripts/ (where any scripts needed to run alongside notebooks will live)
        - script1.py
        - script2.py
        - ...

This structure is going to help keep all of my work organized in a central easy to read and use repository. There may be explanation files or readme files inside of project folders as well.
